# 📖 Data Fundamentals Final Project <a name="about-project"></a>

This  is a written version of your README with all the sections adapted for an Event Management and Ticketing database which   includes event listings, users, and bookings, plus admin control and RLS (Row Level Security).

This is a secure event ticketing platform built using Supabase (PostgreSQL). It allows users to browse events, purchase tickets, and manage bookings  while administrators can manage events, users, and sales analytics.

The project demonstrates Row Level Security (RLS), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and secure database design principles to ensure users only access their own data.

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

This project is designed to be deployed on Supabase. Follow these steps to set up your own instance.

### Prerequisites

To run this project you need:

- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account (free tier available)
- Basic understanding of SQL and PostgreSQL
- A SQL client or the Supabase SQL Editor

### Setup

1. **Create a Supabase Project**
   - Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Choose an organization and fill in project details

2. **Clone this repository** (optional, for reference):
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PetitKwoba/data-fundamentals-final-project.git
   cd data-fundamentals-final-project
   ```

### Install

1. **Execute the Database Schema**
   - Open your Supabase project
   - Navigate to the SQL Editor
   - Copy the entire contents of `schema.sql`
   - Paste and execute the SQL commands

2. **Verify Table Creation**
   - Go to Table Editor in Supabase
   - Confirm you see: `users`, `projects`, and `tasks` tables
   - Check that sample data is populated (5+ rows per table)

3. **Enable Authentication**
   - Navigate to Authentication settings
   - Enable Email/Password or Magic Link authentication
   - Configure email templates as needed

### Usage

#### For Regular Users:
- Sign up through Supabase Auth
- Your user record will be created with `role = 'user'`
- You can view, create, update, and delete your own projects and tasks
- You cannot access other users' data

#### For Administrators:
- Users with `role = 'admin'` in the users table have full access
- Can view and manage all users, projects, and tasks
- Can execute admin-only functions:
  ```sql
  -- Delete any project
  SELECT delete_project('project-uuid-here');
  
  -- Get user statistics
  SELECT * FROM get_user_statistics();
  
  -- Archive old completed projects
  SELECT * FROM archive_old_projects();
  ```

### Database Structure

#### Users Table
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| email | TEXT | User email (unique) |
| full_name | TEXT | User's full name |

| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Creation timestamp |

#### Projects Table
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| user_id | UUID | Foreign key to users |
| name | TEXT | Project name |
| description | TEXT | Project description |
| status | TEXT | 'active', 'completed', or 'archived' |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Creation timestamp |

#### Tasks Table
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| project_id | UUID | Foreign key to projects |
| user_id | UUID | Foreign key to users |
| title | TEXT | Task title |
| description | TEXT | Task description |
| priority | TEXT | 'low', 'medium', or 'high' |
| completed | BOOLEAN | Completion status |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Creation timestamp |

## 🔐 Security Implementation <a name="security"></a>

This project demonstrates comprehensive database security using PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) and role-based access control.

### User Roles

#### Admin Role
- **Full Access**: Can view, insert, update, and delete all data in all tables
- **Administrative Functions**: Can execute admin-only custom functions
- **User Management**: Can manage user accounts and roles

#### User Role  
- **Restricted Access**: Can only view and modify their own data
- **Data Isolation**: Cannot access other users' projects or tasks
- **Role Protection**: Cannot change their own role to admin

### Row Level Security Policies

All tables have RLS enabled with specific policies:

#### Users Table Policies
- ✅ Users can view their own profile
- ✅ Users can update their own profile (except role)
- ✅ Admins can view all users
- ✅ Admins have full access to manage users

#### Projects Table Policies
- ✅ Users can view/create/update/delete their own projects
- ✅ Admins have full access to all projects

#### Tasks Table Policies
- ✅ Users can view/create/update/delete their own tasks
- ✅ Admins have full access to all tasks

### Admin-Only Functions

1. **delete_project(project_id UUID)**
   - Deletes any project regardless of ownership
   - Uses SECURITY DEFINER for elevated privileges

2. **get_user_statistics()**
   - Returns aggregated statistics about users and their activity
   - Useful for admin dashboards and reporting

3. **archive_old_projects()**
   - Automatically archives projects completed over 90 days ago
   - Returns count of archived projects

<!-- FAQ -->

## ❓ FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

**How do I make a user an admin?**

Update the user's role in the users table (requires admin access):
```sql
UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

**Why can't I see other users' data?**

This is by design! Row Level Security ensures users can only access their own data. Only admin users can see all data.

**How do I test the security policies?**

Sign in as different users (admin and regular user) and try to access various data. Regular users should only see their own projects and tasks.
